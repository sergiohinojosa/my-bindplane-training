In this hands-on lab, you're going to build a Telemetry Pipeline end-to-end. Using **Bindplane** as your collection and processing layer and **Dynatrace** as your observability backend, you'll collect syslog data from a Linux host, shape it in-flight, and deliver it to Dynatrace, where **OpenPipeline** takes over to parse and further enrich it.


Hello guys! this is fast! My Bindplane

By the end of the lab, you'll know how to:

- Deploy and configure a Bindplane agent on a Linux host
- Define sources, processors, and destinations in a Bindplane configuration
- Enrich logs with custom metadata before they leave the host
- Parse structured fields out of raw syslog content using Dynatrace OpenPipeline
- Detect and mask sensitive credentials in-flight using regex-based redaction
- Route logs selectively so only the right data passes through each processor
- Convert log events into metrics and query them with DQL
- Monitor the health of your Bindplane pipeline itself using self-monitoring

## Prerequisites
- Bindplane account and project
- Dynatrace tenant
- Dynatrace token with the following permissions:
    - storage:logs:write
    - openpipeline:logs:ingest
    - storage:metrics:write
    - openpipeline:metrics:ingest
- One of:
    - For working entirely in a browser: access to GitHub Codespaces
    - For working locally in a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial):
        - VSCode
        - Dev Containers Extension installed
        - Docker
